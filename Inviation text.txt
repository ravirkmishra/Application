Dear All,

A Wedding is start of
togetherness…
Of walks in the rain, basking in
the sunshine, shared meals, and
sensing the love that a marriage
carries!


With God’s grace, and our parent’s
blessings, the day has come
when
Anuradha Pandey & I are taking a step
forward to begin a wonderful
life together!

Please consider this as a personal invitation and make the occasion more special
with your graceful presence on 18th April-2018.

Please find the invitation card attached.
